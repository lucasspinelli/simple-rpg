### Basic RPG Using C# 

I see a challenge on youtube, to create a project in 100 days, and you must to code at least one hour in this 100 days
so, I choos try to build a simple RPG, with monster, travels, fights and quests, in the old way, just a game master,some creativity and hopefully a lot of fun , in just 100 days.
